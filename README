    API

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.00000_01

SYNOPSIS
      use Net::Twitter::Light;

      my $ntl = Net::Twitter::Light->new(username => $user, password => $password);

      my $result = $ntl->update('Hello, world!');

      eval {
          my $feed = $ntl->friends_timeline({ since_id => $high_water, count => 100 });
          for my $status ( @$feed ) {
              say "$status->{user}{screen_name}: $status->{text};
          }
      };
      if ( @_ ) {
          if( my $e = TwitterException->caught() ) {
              warn "$e\n";
          }
          elsif ( $e = HttpException->caught() ) {
              warn "Network connection down?\n";
          }
          else {
              die $@; # something bad happened
          }
      }

DESCRIPTION
    Net::Twitter::Lite attempts to provide a lean, robust, and easy to
    maintain perl interface to the Twitter API. It provides some basic
    compatibility with the Net::Twitter module. It takes a different
    approach in some areas, however, so it is not a drop-in replacement. See
    Net::Twitter::Lite::Compat, included with this distribution, for a
    Net::Twitter compatible interface.

    Net::Twitter::Lite uses Moose. Some may contend Moose and Lite are
    mutually exclusive. Moose greatly reduces the number of lines of code
    necessary to accomplish the goals of Net::Twitter::Lite, so the author
    finds the name appropriate.

    Most Twitter API methods take parameters. All Net::Twitter::Lite API
    methods will accept a HASH ref of named parameters as specified in the
    Twitter API documentation. For convenience, many Net::Twitter::Lite
    methods accept simple placeholder arguments as documented, below. The
    placeholder parameter passing style is optional; you can always use the
    named parameters in a hash ref if you prefer.

    Net::Twitter::Lite does not do aggressive parameter validation. It will
    dutifully pass invalid parameters to Twitter if instructed, and if
    Twitter returns an error as a result, Net::Twitter::Lite will throw an
    appropriate exception.

    The lack of aggressive parameter checking has an advantage. If Twitter
    adds new parameters to any of the API methods, you may begin using them
    immediately without warnings or errors and without any need for
    modification to the source code of this module.

    Net::Twitter::Lite differs from Net::Twitter significantly in its error
    handling strategy. It throws exceptions in response to Twitter API and
    network errors. You can catch and deal with these errors using eval
    blocks in the usual way. Throwing exceptions allows Net::Twitter::Lite
    to work well with LWP::UserAgent::POE in an environment where there may
    be concurrent requests.

    For compatibility with Net::Twitter, this distribution includes
    Net::Twitter::Lite::Compat. It provides the same error handling strategy
    as Net::Twitter returning "undef" on error with "get_error",
    "http_code", and "http_message" methods to determine the nature of the
    error.

METHODS
    new This creates a new instance of Net::Twitter::Lite. It accepts
        several named arguments, all of them optional:

        username
            This is the username or email address used to authenticate with
            Twitter.

        password
            This is the password used to authenticate with Twitter.

        useragent
            This is the useragent string passed in each request to twitter.
            It defaults to "Net::Twitter::Lite/0.00000_01".

        source
            This is the application source identifier passed to twitter with
            the "update" method. It defaults to "twitterpm".

        apiurl
            This is the base URL for the Twitter API methods. It defaults to
            "http://twitter.com". You may use a different URL to specify
            another service, such as <http://identi.ca> that provides a
            Twitter Compatible API. Also, see "apihost" and "apirealm",
            below.

        apihost
            This is the "netloc" argument passed to LWP::UserAgent
            internally as part of the HTTP Basic Authentication protocol. It
            defaults to "twitter.com:80".

        apirealm
            This is the "realm" argument passed to LWP::UserAgent internally
            as port of the HTTP Basic Authentication protocol. It defaults
            to "Twitter API".

        useragent_class
            This is the name of the useragent class used internally. It
            defaults to "LWP::UserAgent". You may pass "LWP::UserAgent::POE"
            or another LWP::UserAgent compatible class instead.

    credentials($username, $password)
        This method can be used to set or change the "username" and
        "password" used to authenticated with Twitter.

API METHODS
  Status Methods
    public_timeline
        Parameters: *none*

        Returns the 20 most recent statuses from non-protected users who
        have set a custom user icon. Does not require authentication. Note
        that the public timeline is cached for 60 seconds so requesting it
        more often than that is a waste of resources.

        Returns: ArrayRef[Status]

    friends_timeline
        Parameters: since, since_id, count, page

        Returns the 20 most recent statuses posted by the authenticating
        user and that user's friends. This is the equivalent of /home on the
        Web.

        Returns: ArrayRef[Status]

    user_timeline
        Parameters: id, count, since, since_id

        Returns the 20 most recent statuses posted from the authenticating
        user. It's also possible to request another user's timeline via the
        id parameter. This is the equivalent of the Web /archive page for
        your own user, or the profile page for a third party.

        Returns: ArrayRef[Status]

    show_status
    show_status(id)
        Parameters: id

        Returns a single status, specified by the id parameter. The status's
        author will be returned inline.

        Returns: Status

    update
    update(status)
        Parameters: status, in_reply_to_status_id

        Updates the authenticating user's status. Requires the status
        parameter specified. A status update with text identical to the
        authenticating user's current status will be ignored.

        Returns: Status

    replies
        Parameters: page, since, since_id

        Returns the 20 most recent @replies (status updates prefixed with
        @username) for the authenticating user.

        Returns: ArrayRef[Status]

    destroy_status
    destroy_status(id)
        Parameters: id

        Destroys the status specified by the required ID parameter. The
        authenticating user must be the author of the specified status.

        Returns: Status

  User Methods
    friends
        Parameters: id, page

        Returns the authenticating user's friends, each with current status
        inline. They are ordered by the order in which they were added as
        friends. It's also possible to request another user's recent friends
        list via the id parameter.

        Returns: ArrayRef[BasicUser]

    followers
        Parameters: id, page

        Returns the authenticating user's followers, each with current
        status inline. They are ordered by the order in which they joined
        Twitter (this is going to be changed).

        Returns: ArrayRef[BasicUser]

    show_user
    show_user(id)
        Parameters: id, email

        Returns extended information of a given user, specified by ID or
        screen name as per the required id parameter. This information
        includes design settings, so third party developers can theme their
        widgets according to a given user's preferences. You must be
        properly authenticated to request the page of a protected user.

        Returns: ExtendedUser

  Direct Message Methods
